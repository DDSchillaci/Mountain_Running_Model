# Mountain_Running_Model
Random Forest Model using the Ranger package to predict moving time based on personal activity data

This Model was developed for my GIS335 class final project, Spring 2025

This model's training data was based within the High Peaks Region of the Adirondack park. 
All runs in the dataset are trail runs
GPS/pace/elevation data was collected using either a Garmin Forerunner 245 or a Wahoo Rival GPS watch
Heart rate data was collected with a Polar H10 Chest strap monitor

Each run was given a subjective terrain score between 1 and 5 trying to account for how much the technicality of the terrain effected movement - 
1 = packed down gravel rail-trail, 3= Some rocks and roots but still very runable,  5= Rock hopping, mud, snow, ice, rockclimbing/scrambling.
